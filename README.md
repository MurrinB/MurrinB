### Hi there 👋 
I'm Britnee. I currently work as a Patient Care Tech at DaVita for dialysis patients. I have come to be interested in the continously expanding world of technology! I am a software developer in training and I look forward to learning all I can about programming.

## 💻 In this account you will find many of the programs I have built while studying at <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>. 
I have used many languages including: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL and JavaScript. With each new language I dive into, I get more excited about coding!  

## ✍️ I am currently working on a Live Project with other up and coming developers!
