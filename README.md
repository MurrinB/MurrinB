## Hi there üëã 
I'm Britnee. I currently work as a Patient Care Tech at DaVita for dialysis patients. I have come to be interested in the continously expanding world of technology! I am a junior software developer!

## üíª In this account you will find many of the programs I have built while studying at <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a>. 
I have used many languages including: Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, C# and JavaScript. I am familiar with MVC, .Net Framework, and Django. With each new language I dive into, I get more excited about coding!  

## ‚úçÔ∏è I am currently on the job market and ready to help with your projects!
